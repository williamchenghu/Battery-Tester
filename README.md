# Battery-Tester
Arduino based battery capacity and internal resistance tester

2 Modes are available at booting.
   - Capacity Test Mode
   - Internal Resistance Test Mode

Uses Arduino Pro Mini  
Uses Philips PCD8544 (Nokia 5110) Display (84*48 dots)
Uses 2 Ohm power resister (10W) as shunt. Load can be added in series via screw terminal.
Uses logic level N-channel MOSFET (IRLR3103) controls shunt.
